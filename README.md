# The-Room-Conundrum
This project was done as part of my dissertation in my final year of University. 

The-Room-Conundrum.7z contains the Unreal Project (which requires Unreal Engine 4.24.3) while WindowsNoEditor.7z contains an executable which does not require Unreal to run.
The word document in this repo is my written dissertation, which contains screenshots and details on how the blueprints in the unreal project work. It also has a write-up about The Turing Test,
and other games that fit in the genre of 'Interactive Fiction'
